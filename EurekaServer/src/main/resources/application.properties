# --- Eureka Server Configuration ---

# Port for the Eureka Server itself (8761 is conventional)
server.port=8761

# Application name for the Eureka server
spring.application.name=eureka-server

# --- Eureka Client settings *for the server itself* ---
# In a standalone setup, the server does not need to register with itself.
eureka.client.register-with-eureka=false

# The server also does not need to fetch registry information from itself.
eureka.client.fetch-registry=false

# (Optional but Recommended for standalone) Define the default zone URL pointing to itself,
# primarily so clients know where to register if they only configure the default zone.
# If running multiple Eureka instances (peers), this would point to the other peers.
eureka.client.service-url.defaultZone=http://localhost:8761/eureka/

# (Optional) Set hostname if needed, otherwise it uses machine hostname
# eureka.instance.hostname=localhost
